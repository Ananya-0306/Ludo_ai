Pig - a simple dice game
---------------------
Pig is a game played with one dice, luck-based and strategy-based (a little).


Run
--------------
```
pip3 install pygame
```
```
python3 main.py
```



Rules
------------------
Here you play against an AI-bot. Your turn is first (love to user :) ).          
Your goal is to gain 100 points faster than bot.                
To gain points, you should roll the dice with corresponding button.            
You can roll several times, then your turn score gets higher.            
To save gained score, press Hold.
In case of one at the dice, your score for a turn gets equal to zero, and turn goes to bot.

Good luck!
